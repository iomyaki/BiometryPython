# BiometryPython

I wrote this script from a fool, so it's full of shit, but it works

Download data in **.csv** format


Download **python3** 


Download **git** (click on the link [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.37.0.windows.1/Git-2.37.0-32-bit.exe))


Download the **Biometry.py**:

> git clone https://github.com/wertick01/BiometryPython.git

or download .zip archive and unzip it


Then write to the command line:

> python C:\PATH\TO\BiometryPython\Biometry.py 

or

> python3 C:\PATH\TO\Biometry.py


After running the script, an instruction will appear. Follow it.
