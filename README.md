# BiometryPython

I wrote this script from a fool, so it's full of shit, but it works

Download data in .csv format


Download python3 


Open the command line (or Terminal [Ctrl+Alt+t in Linux])


To download necessary libraries copy and put into the command line the next command:

> pip install numpy pandas datetime scipy sklearn colorama datetime math 

or 

> python pip install numpy pandas datetime scipy sklearn colorama datetime math

Download the Biometry.py:

> wget https://github.com/wertick01/BiometryPython

or

> git clone https://github.com/wertick01/BiometryPython.git

or download .zip archive and unzip it

Then write to the command line:

> python C:\PATH\TO\BiometryPython\Biometry.py 

or

> python3 C:\path\to\Biometry.py

After running the script, an instruction will appear. Follow it.
