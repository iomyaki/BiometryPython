# BiometryPython

I wrote this script from a fool, so it's full of shit, but it works

Download data in **.csv** format


Download and install **python3** (click on the link https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.5/Python-3.10.5.tar.xz)


Download and install **git** (https://www.python.org/downloads/)


Download and install **Biometry.py**:

> git clone https://github.com/wertick01/BiometryPython.git

or download .zip archive and unzip it


Then write to the command line:

> python C:\PATH\TO\BiometryPython\Biometry.py 

or

> python3 C:\PATH\TO\Biometry.py


After running the script, an instruction will appear. Follow it.
