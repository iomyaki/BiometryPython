# BiometryPython

I wrote this script from a fool, so it's full of shit, but it works

Download data in .csv format

Download python3 

Open the command line (or Terminal [Ctrl+Alt+t in Linux])

To download necessary libraries copy and put into the command line the next command:

pip install numpy pandas datetime scipy sklearn colorama datetime math 

(or "python pip install numpy pandas datetime scipy sklearn colorama datetime math")

Then write to the command line:
python C:\path\to\Biometry.py (or python3 C:\path\to\Biometry.py)

After running the script, an instruction will appear. Follow it.
